                <p style="

            <p style="width:300px;height:100px;display:inline-block;">This technical eagerness later went onto fixing his old house. Any broken circuits or machinery, he would try to fix. But there was a creative aspect missing to it and that's why he started using hardware store materials to make cheap jewelry and sell it.</p>

            <p style="width:300px;height:100px;display:inline-block;">And then came the music. After playing the violin for 10 years, he decided to try the guitar. He fell in love with it. He loved the creative side of it, but was seeking something technical to do as well: he decided to build a website about rock music. </p>

            <p style="display:none;">And now, after 21 years, he believes that any technical capacity has to be used in a creative manner. If not, then it becomes useless.</p>
            <p style="display:none;">But he also believes that the most creative ideas can only be produced with some technical knowledge. </p>
            <p style="display:none;">In other words, <strong>creativity</strong> and <strong>technical knowledge</strong> go hand in hand.</p>
